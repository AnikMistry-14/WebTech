                <h2> How coastal cities are adapting to sea-level rise</h2>
                <time datetime="2025-11-10">Nov 10, 2025</time><br><br>
                <img src="./img6.jpg" alt="Coastal city adaptation" style="height:150px;">
                <p>
                    Around 600 million people live in coastal zones less than 10 metres above average sea level, and more than half of the world’s megacities are coastal.1 While all coastal cities face some degree of risk, some will experience higher local sea level rise and face an existential threat.2

                    In this article, we look at the three main approaches cities can take to adapt to sea level rise: protecting the coastline with flood defences; reducing the impact of coastal flooding by upgrading and adapting buildings and infrastructure; and retreating from at-risk areas. The city’s adaptation strategy must be underpinned by evidence of the risks the city faces and be developed with the in-depth engagement of local people, businesses and government departments at various levels.
                    The risk of coastal flooding a city faces depends on its physical geography and built characteristics, the subsidence (sinking) of the land on which it is built and the projected global sea-level rise. Subsidence can have natural or human causes, including porous ground rock, the movement of tectonic plates, unmanaged groundwater extraction and the weight of development.

                    Begin by assessing how these factors shape local vulnerability to coastal flooding and sea level rise. Partner with research institutions, meteorological departments and non-governmental organisations to develop this assessment. Ideally, it should be carried out within the city’s wider climate change risk assessment. Read How to conduct a climate change risk assessment for advice on doing this as part of climate action planning.

                    Explore whether robust risk maps have already been produced for your locality. South African cities, for example, can use the coastal flood risk assessment from the Green Book. If not, the main approaches cities can take to assess their vulnerability are:

                    Map areas at risk of coastal flooding. Explore available satellite imagery, other topographical and land-use data, and recordings of historical high-water events to map and estimate risks. NASA’s sea level projection tool provides an indicative sea level rise for coastal locations around the world, presenting the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change data and projections.6 Rio de Janeiro is collaborating with NASA to access satellite imagery and data to understand the impacts of sea level rise.7 The Coastal Risk Screening Tool from Climate Central also allows cities to explore which areas are at risk of coastal flooding over time, with different levels of sea level rise producing crude coastal risk maps. Participatory mapping and drones also offer a way to plug gaps. Residents of Dar es Salaam’s slums, which are not included in official maps and at high risk of flash and coastal flooding, are mapping their neighbourhoods using ‘walk-throughs’, drones and simple GPS, with the help of Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team.
                    Model the coastal risk system. Modelling is more complex and costly than mapping, but delivers more detailed information. Qingdao worked with a local university to develop a coastal risk-system model that combines natural and human risk factors and has identified adaptation strategies with the potential to reduce the risk from coastal flooding by 80% over the next five to ten years.8 A team of University of Massachusetts Boston scientists and modellers from Woods Hole Group created a probabilistic flood-risk model that predicts coastal flooding risks and flood depths from coastal storms and sea level rise; the results can be explored on the City of Boston website.
                    Collaborate with other cities and local and regional authorities
                    Coastal flooding and rising seas are not localised issues. Defences in one place – or a lack thereof – can have implications for others. For example, if your city builds a sea-wall barrier that will protect against a once‐in‐a‐century event, while a neighbouring city has built a structure for a once-in-a-decade event, your city may be impacted by a storm surge from the breached wall along the coast. Equally, monitoring and alert systems can be shared across a coastal region. Coordinating with other cities and authorities in the region can increase effectiveness of action and help to pool resources, among other things.

                    Establishing a regional board or working group can help to coordinate a regional strategy to address sea level rise and coastal flooding. A good example is the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact, which was established in 2009 by Broward, Miami-Dade, Monroe and Palm Beach Counties to coordinate action to increase the region’s climate resilience, share tools and knowledge and increase political will.

                    Work with local community groups to ensure that the needs of the most vulnerable are met in planning. How to engage stakeholders for powerful and inclusive climate action planning presents tools and approaches. In New York’s Jamaica Bay, for instance, community, labour and civil-society groups from neighbourhoods most impacted by Superstorm Sandy formed the Sandy Regional Assembly, working with the city government to shape recovery and resilience-building efforts and to plan for managed retreat.9 The Assembly published a recovery agenda to integrate regional rebuilding efforts with local priorities, reduce public health threats and expand community-based climate change planning and disaster preparedness.10

                    Improve coastal flood defences to reduce the likelihood and severity of flooding
                    This is about keeping water away from the built environment. There are two main ways in which to protect coastlines from floods, storm surge and inundation – restoring natural coastal ecosystems or building physical, synthetic structures – but cities can also use a mixture of the two.

                    The appropriate approach will depend on the physical characteristics of the coastline, as well as the infrastructure and population in the area at risk. For example, a city located on a wide river delta may find physical structures too large and expensive to build, while nature-based options may not be viable in a deep harbour. Work with experts to conduct a thorough analysis of what solutions can work and the business case for them.

                    Coastal ecosystem restoration. Coastal wetlands, coral reefs, marshes and mangroves provide a nature-based defence against coastal flooding and storm surges, reducing the need for man-made physical defences. Coastal wetlands in the United States alone provide storm protection worth an estimated US$23.2 billion per year, and avoided US$625 million in direct flood damage during Hurricane Sandy.11, 12 Protecting and restoring this natural infrastructure offers an affordable adaptation solution against rising seas. These ecosystems store water, stabilise sediment, prevent erosion and reduce wave height. The Nature Conservancy’s guidelines on mangroves as a coastal defence for coastal managers and policymakers is a useful guide. The ecological complexity of restoring natural chemical, physical and biological characteristics means that cities should consider working with experts and environment agencies to design and deliver these projects. Cities should also support any larger-scale efforts to address environmental degradation along the coast.

                    This short clip demonstrates the protection offered by mangroves:

                <h2>World Leaders Meet for Climate Summit</h2>
                <time datetime="2025-11-15">Nov 15, 2025</time><br><br>
                <img src="./img1.jpg" alt="Summit photo" style="height:150px;">
                <p>
                    Not many are hopeful that the ongoing climate summit (COP30) at Belém, Brazil, will yield tangible results. The cynicism is not without reason. Critics and protestors have dismissively called the event a ‘climate casino’, accusing world leaders of making empty promises and doing nothing amid growing alarm over unchecked environmental degradation.
                    A staggering 50,000 delegates will converge during the 12-day summit (10–21 November) being held at this ‘gateway to the Amazon rainforest’— the world’s largest tropical forest, also known as the lungs of the earth, which produces 20 per cent of the planet’s oxygen and plays a critical role in global carbon sequestration.
                    The slightly wishful idea of holding it in Belém is to draw global attention to the risks of unchecked deforestation, which is greatly exacerbating the effects of climate change.
                    Despite decades of conferences and pious pledges, the climate crisis has only worsened. Natural forests are dwindling at an alarming rate as governments yield to ‘development’ pressures and make over vast tracts to mining and other companies with an appetite for forest resources.
                    These leaders are all ‘pro-business’, the protestors argue, indifferent to the environmental costs borne by the world’s poorest. “We can’t eat money,” they say, as millions lose homes and livelihoods to fires, floods and droughts.
                    Government leaders and big business couldn’t care less, possibly because they don’t yet feel the heat. Donald Trump, President of the United States, still one of the world’s biggest polluters, says climate change is a hoax. The heads of state of the world’s three largest polluters—China, the US and India—have all decided to stay away, underscoring their apathy. Which begs the question: have the COP summits— like the UN itself—lost their relevance?
                    China, even while leading in greenhouse gas emissions, has made impressive progress in renewable energy and electric vehicles, meeting 2030 targets ahead of schedule. On the other hand, India, Iran and the US remain heavily dependent on fossil fuels and show little interest in leading a global transition. They disregard the risks of small island countries in the Pacific Ocean (Marshall Islands, Samoa, Nauru and Fiji), the Caribbean (Barbados, Jamaica, Bahamas, Haiti, St Kitts and Nevis) and Indian Ocean states (Maldives, Mauritius and Seychelles)—all at risk of being swallowed by rising seas.

                <h2>Russia-Ukraine talks in Istanbul show unexpected progress: Turkey</h2>
                <time datetime="2025-05-16">May 05, 2025</time><br><br>
                <img src="./img4.jpg" alt="Peace talks" style="height:150px;">
                <p>The latest Russia-Ukraine peace talks in Istanbul have shown signs of progress beyond expectations, according to a Turkish official cited by CNN on Friday.

                   "It was more positive than expected. They didn’t use accusatory language," the official said, highlighting a notably less confrontational tone during the session.

                    The talks marked the first direct meeting between the two delegations in three years and were held under the chairmanship of Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan. The official said the meeting was significant simply because both sides agreed to attend. "The fact that they came to Istanbul can be seen as a need on their part to find a way out."
                    Russia’s ceasefire terms include territorial withdrawal request
                    As part of the Russia-Ukraine ceasefire discussions, the Turkish official revealed that Moscow had requested Kiev withdraw from certain territories still under Ukrainian control. This demand was made in the context of a proposed ceasefire deal.

                    The Ukrainian delegation did not immediately respond to the demand but reportedly left the room to consult with leadership, especially after Turkiye proposed a prisoner-of-war (POW) exchange covering three categories: children, civilians, and soldiers.

                    The official noted that the Russian delegation required fewer consultations during the discussions, indicating that they may have entered the talks with a clearer position.

                    Major POW exchange agreed by both sides
                    Russian presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, who leads the Russian delegation, announced that both parties had agreed on a large-scale prisoner exchange involving 1,000 detainees from each side.

                    The agreement represents a potential breakthrough in humanitarian cooperation amid continued hostilities, and it follows Turkish mediation in Russia-Ukraine talks.
