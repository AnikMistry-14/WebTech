                    Bangkok, Thailand, November 12, 2025: The UAE jiu-jitsu national under-21 team, sponsored by Mubadala Investment Company, began its campaign at the 2025 World Championships (U16, U18, U21) in Bangkok, Thailand, with a strong performance that earned the athletes a total of seven medals, including two gold, three silver and two bronze. The championship runs from November 12 to 14.
                    Amaar Alhosani captured gold in the under-94kg category, while Rashed Alshehhi won gold in the 56kg division. Fahad Alhammadi earned silver in the 77kg category, with Rashid Alhimany taking silver in the over-94kg division and Mohamed Al Shehhi adding another silver in the 56kg category. Faisal Alwahedi secured bronze in the 69 kg category, while Abdulrahman Mohammed claimed bronze in the 62 kg division.
                    Mubarak Al Menhali, director of the technical department, UAEJJF, said: “Today’s results show how well the system for developing jiu-jitsu in the UAE is working. Every success comes from teamwork that starts with the support of families, continues through schools and clubs, and is strengthened by the Federation’s vision to build future champions.”
                    Gold medallist Rashed Alshehhi said: “Winning today means more than just getting a medal. It’s a message to all young Emiratis that determination makes the difference. I started in school, where I learnt that jiu-jitsu is more than a sport. It teaches respect, confidence and teamwork. My family has always supported me, and their encouragement helped me give my best.”
                    The championship continues Thursday, November 13, with the under-21 women’s division, where the UAE team will aim to build on its success and add more medals to the country’s tally.

                <p>Tennis enthusiasts around the world are abuzz as the Next Gen ATP Finals in Jeddah are set to commence. China’s 19-year-old tennis prodigy, Shang Juncheng, is preparing to face France’s Luca Van Assche in tonight’s highly anticipated opening match.

                   The atmosphere in Jeddah is electric. The eight finalists have arrived in Saudi Arabia, embracing the opportunity to unwind before the competition heats up. Shang and his fellow competitors enjoyed a relaxing day aboard a yacht, where they participated in a friendly swimming race in the pristine waters of the Red Sea.

                   For Shang Juncheng, this tournament represents a pivotal moment in his burgeoning career. “Being at the Next Gen ATP Finals means everything to me,” he shared with palpable excitement. “Some of the best players have competed in this event when they were young, and it’s something truly special. If you look at past champions, Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz—they’ve all played here. Not many players get to compete in this event. I’ve heard it’s amazing, and I just can’t wait to get there.”

                   Shang’s enthusiasm reflects the significance of the Next Gen ATP Finals as a launching pad for the tennis stars of tomorrow. His upcoming match against Van Assche promises to be a showcase of youthful talent and determination.

                   As the tournament unfolds, fans and analysts alike will be watching closely to see how Shang’s performance might signal the rise of a new era in Chinese tennis. With the global spotlight on Jeddah, this event offers a stage for young athletes like Shang to make their mark on the international scene.

                   Tonight’s match is not just a game; it’s a chapter in the evolving story of tennis, where emerging talents are poised to shape the future of the sport. Shang Juncheng stands on the precipice of greatness, ready to embrace the challenge and seize the opportunity to inspire a new generation of tennis enthusiasts.</p>
