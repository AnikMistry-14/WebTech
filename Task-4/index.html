                <h2>World Leaders Meet for Climate Summit</h2>
                <time datetime="2025-11-15">Nov 15, 2025</time><br><br>

                    Not many are hopeful that the ongoing climate summit (COP30) at Belém, Brazil, will yield tangible results. The cynicism is not without reason. Critics and protestors have dismissively called the event a ‘climate casino’, accusing world leaders of making empty promises and doing nothing amid growing alarm over unchecked environmental degradation.
                    A staggering 50,000 delegates will converge during the 12-day summit (10–21 November) being held at this ‘gateway to the Amazon rainforest’— the world’s largest tropical forest, also known as the lungs of the earth, which produces 20 per cent of the planet’s oxygen and plays a critical role in global carbon sequestration.
                    The slightly wishful idea of holding it in Belém is to draw global attention to the risks of unchecked deforestation, which is greatly exacerbating the effects of climate change.
                    Despite decades of conferences and pious pledges, the climate crisis has only worsened. Natural forests are dwindling at an alarming rate as governments yield to ‘development’ pressures and make over vast tracts to mining and other companies with an appetite for forest resources.
                    These leaders are all ‘pro-business’, the protestors argue, indifferent to the environmental costs borne by the world’s poorest. “We can’t eat money,” they say, as millions lose homes and livelihoods to fires, floods and droughts.
                    Government leaders and big business couldn’t care less, possibly because they don’t yet feel the heat. Donald Trump, President of the United States, still one of the world’s biggest polluters, says climate change is a hoax. The heads of state of the world’s three largest polluters—China, the US and India—have all decided to stay away, underscoring their apathy. Which begs the question: have the COP summits— like the UN itself—lost their relevance?
                    China, even while leading in greenhouse gas emissions, has made impressive progress in renewable energy and electric vehicles, meeting 2030 targets ahead of schedule. On the other hand, India, Iran and the US remain heavily dependent on fossil fuels and show little interest in leading a global transition. They disregard the risks of small island countries in the Pacific Ocean (Marshall Islands, Samoa, Nauru and Fiji), the Caribbean (Barbados, Jamaica, Bahamas, Haiti, St Kitts and Nevis) and Indian Ocean states (Maldives, Mauritius and Seychelles)—all at risk of being swallowed by rising seas.

                <h2>National Team Wins Championship</h2>
                <time datetime="2025-11-12">Nov 12, 2025</time><br><br>

                    Bangkok, Thailand, November 12, 2025: The UAE jiu-jitsu national under-21 team, sponsored by Mubadala Investment Company, began its campaign at the 2025 World Championships (U16, U18, U21) in Bangkok, Thailand, with a strong performance that earned the athletes a total of seven medals, including two gold, three silver and two bronze. The championship runs from November 12 to 14.
                    Amaar Alhosani captured gold in the under-94kg category, while Rashed Alshehhi won gold in the 56kg division. Fahad Alhammadi earned silver in the 77kg category, with Rashid Alhimany taking silver in the over-94kg division and Mohamed Al Shehhi adding another silver in the 56kg category. Faisal Alwahedi secured bronze in the 69 kg category, while Abdulrahman Mohammed claimed bronze in the 62 kg division.
                    Mubarak Al Menhali, director of the technical department, UAEJJF, said: “Today’s results show how well the system for developing jiu-jitsu in the UAE is working. Every success comes from teamwork that starts with the support of families, continues through schools and clubs, and is strengthened by the Federation’s vision to build future champions.”
                    Gold medallist Rashed Alshehhi said: “Winning today means more than just getting a medal. It’s a message to all young Emiratis that determination makes the difference. I started in school, where I learnt that jiu-jitsu is more than a sport. It teaches respect, confidence and teamwork. My family has always supported me, and their encouragement helped me give my best.”
                    The championship continues Thursday, November 13, with the under-21 women’s division, where the UAE team will aim to build on its success and add more medals to the country’s tally.

                <h2>New Smartphone Sets Record Sales</h2>
                <time datetime="2025-11-13">Nov 13, 2025</time><br><br>
                <img src="./img3.jpg" alt="Smartphone image" style="height: 150px;">
                <p>Google is making serious gains in the high-end smartphone market. Despite facing heavy competition from the launch of Apple’s iPhone 17 series, the Pixel 10 lineup helped Google achieve an unprecedented milestone: a new single-month sales record in the U.S.
                   The data comes from a recent report from Counterpoint Research. The report shows that Google’s Pixel sales in the U.S. jumped a massive 28% year-over-year in September 2025. Not surprisingly, Google’s market share still remains a fraction of giants like Apple and Samsung. However, this growth shows a real momentum for the nearly decade-old phone brand.</p>
